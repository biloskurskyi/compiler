# compiler  
Using this computing machine, you will be able to solve simple tasks in assembly language.  
The program is written in a special file (code.txt),   
after which each operation that needs to be performed is calculated in compiler.py,   
and the result is output in the vm.py file.  
  
In this program, there is no strict requirement for the spacing between lines;   
errors can only occur in case of incorrect syntax.
